# Weather-Dashboard API Project

This is a project for the UCB Coding Bootcamp

## Description

This goal of this project was to use 3rd party API's to get data and display it on a webpage
This site takes the input city and uses Open Weather's One Call API to find the coordinates of a given city, and then with that generates a weather report
It also saves the history of previous locations to local storage
